### Description:
All game scripts are in [Assets/Scripts.](https://github.com/Username-107/Smashy-Builder/tree/main/Assets/Scripts) The artwork was recieved from [a 2D Unity course on Udemy.](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) Individual scripts are mostly simple, but the project is all about the intricacy of the scripts.
